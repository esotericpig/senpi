# Contributing to senpi

Before contributing to **senpi**, always check the open and **closed** [Issues](https://github.com/esotericpig/senpi/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/esotericpig/senpi/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed) first, as it may have already been resolved/added.

## Bug? Enhancement?

If it is a Bug or an Enhancement and you don't feel like making a pull request, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/esotericpig/senpi/issues) with the appropriate Label. If it is related to a certain version, build environment, OS, etc., please include this information. Thanks.

If your request is turned down, please take it gracefully, and you can always fork the project!

## Minor change?

If it is a minor change, such as fixing whitespace or a spelling error, always make an [Issue](https://github.com/esotericpig/senpi/issues) for this and please add **[Minor]** to the beginning of the title, as well as a **minor** Label if possible.

Pull requests related to minor issues will probably be unaccepted.

## Pull request?

If you believe that you have solved a non-minor bug and/or have made a non-minor enhancement, please create a pull request.

To create a pull request, first, fork the project. Then create a branch with a descriptive name. Then commit your changes to that branch on your fork. Finally, create a pull request. See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) for more information.

Please adhere to the source code and license guidelines.

### Source code guidelines
- For the most part, use standard Java guidelines.
- Use UTF-8 with Linux line endings ('\n', **not** '\r\n' or '\r') ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on Windows makes this easy).
- Only use 2 spaces for indents. Do **not** use tabs.
- I personally use a right margin of 110, but you can use anything <= 110. Do **not** use a right margin > 110.
- Quirky comments and/or identifiers are acceptable. ;)

### License guidelines
Any code that you want merged must use the LGPL-3.0 (or higher) license, and you must accept this if you wish for your code to be included. (This is actually the default for any project according to the [GitHub terms](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) you agree to when you sign up).

Please add a new **@author** with your name (and any contact information) to the top of the file's comment block. If it is a completely new file, it will only contain your name as the author. If you modify a file, then your name will go under the last **@author** on a new line:

```Java
/**
 * @author Sen Pi
 * @author My Name
 */
```
